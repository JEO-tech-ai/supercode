## Verification Checklist

### Pre-Implementation
- [x] Read OPENCODE_ANALYSIS.md
- [x] Analyze current supercoin structure
- [x] Research OpenCode tech stack
- [x] Create phase plans
- [x] Create work tracking structure

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] All 143 existing tests still pass
- [ ] TypeScript type checking passes
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] CLI still works
- [ ] New features work as documented

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. Using Turborepo for monorepo management (same as OpenCode)
2. SolidJS for web console (same as OpenCode)
3. Kobalte for UI primitives (same as OpenCode)
4. Drizzle ORM with SQLite for local dev, D1 for production
5. SST v3 for infrastructure as code

### Risk Mitigation
1. Keep original `src/` directory during migration
2. Use git branches for safe experimentation
3. Migrate incrementally, verifying at each step
4. Maintain backwards compatibility with existing CLI
